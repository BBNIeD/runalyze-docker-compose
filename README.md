# runalyze-docker-compose

## Motivation
Runalyze is a great tool to analyse your running activity and measure the progress. In addition it enables you to save personal data such as geo coordinates or heart rate of the sport activity where it belongs, on your personal computer.

As Runalyze is a web application some infrastructure components like a web-server with php and a database are needed. This docker compose project should make the setup as easy as possible.

## Limitation
Runalyze moved from an open source model to closed source. The last released version contains a bug and a unclear license situation. Hence, not a bugfix is provided but a instruction to patch the last release.

## Credits

Thank you, Runalyze Team for providing this amazing tool. It is still one of my frequently used tools to track my running activities.
